            Large deviations theory is a branch of probability theory that
            concerns itself with the probabilities of rare events and the
            exponential decay of these probabilities.

          Introduction
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Large deviations theory provides a mathematical framework for
          understanding how the probability of rare events decays exponentially
          as a system size grows. This theory has profound applications in
          statistical mechanics, information theory, queueing theory, and
          machine learning, particularly in understanding the behavior of neural
          networks and optimization algorithms.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          The central object of study is the rate function, which characterizes
          the exponential rate at which probabilities of large deviations decay.
          This framework allows us to make precise statements about events that
          are extremely unlikely but still mathematically significant.

          Rate Functions
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          A rate function I(x) is a lower semicontinuous function that governs
          the exponential decay of probabilities. For a sequence of random
          variables, we say that the sequence satisfies a large deviation
          principle with rate function I if the probability of rare events
          decays like exp(-nI(x)) where n is a scaling parameter.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
          Cramér's Theorem
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
          One of the fundamental results in large deviations theory, Cramér's
          theorem provides the rate function for the sample mean of independent,
          identically distributed random variables. This theorem forms the
          foundation for understanding how sample averages deviate from their
          expected values.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-medium text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-3">
          Sanov's Theorem
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
          Sanov's theorem extends large deviations principles to the empirical
          measure, providing insights into how the distribution of samples
          deviates from the true underlying distribution. This has important
          implications for statistical inference and model validation.
